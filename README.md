## 🔍 Known Considerations

While the project is fully functional and production-ready, there's one notable consideration:

### Next.js Version
The project was initially planned for Next.js 15, but due to time constraints and familiarity with the stable version, it was developed using Next.js 14. This decision was made to ensure:
- Stable production deployment
- Well-documented features
- Proven performance patterns
- Reliable development experience

This doesn't impact the functionality or performance of the application, and upgrading to Next.js 15 would be straightforward in future iterations.
